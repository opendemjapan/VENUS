# The name of an intensity data file including its absolute path.
# (*.ffo created by RIETAN-2000, *.hkl created by EXPO, or *.raw)

# Wavelength (dummy for *.ffo files)

# Which integrated intensities will you use?
# 0: The integrated intensity is defined as |F|^2.
# 1: The integrated intensity is defined as multiplicity X |F|^2.
0

# The initial Lagrangian multiplier.
0.01  

# The coefficient, t, to adjust the Lagrangian multiplier.
0.005

# The coefficient, SCIO, to adjust estimated standard deviations.
# (dummy for *.hkl created by EXPO)

# Will you group overlapped reflections? (NGSW)
# 0: Yes (reflections overlapped heavily are grouped).
# 1: No (all the reflections are independently input).
0

# Maximum difference in d/Angstrom in grouped reflections.
# (dummy if NGSW = 1)
  0.00005

# Parameters (v, p, and b) to estimate standard deviations, s.
