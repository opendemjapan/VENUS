The following three files storing three-dimensional data of 9,10-dioxoanthracene (anthraquinone) are contained in this folder:

Anthraquinone.led: Laplacian of the electron density.
Anthraquinone.ked: kinetic energy.
Anthraquinone.ped: potential energy.

At first, electron densities in 9,10-dioxoanthracene were calculated with Gaussian 98 and saved in a Gaussian Cube file, Anthraquinone.cube, which is contained in folder VENUS\Examples\VEND\Gaussian.

The above three files, Anthraquinone.?ed, were created using a short utility program to convert electron densities into the above three physical quantities according to a procedure described in
V. G. Tsirelson, Acta Crystallogr., Sect. B, 58 (2002) 632-639.
