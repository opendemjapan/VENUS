Files, *.cube, with the Gaussian cube format were output by Gaussian 98 for UNIX using input files, *.com, which are also included in this folder.  

Cartesian coordinates of atoms included in *.cube can also be input by VICS.

The last option, 'read', of the cube properties keyword in *.com is not described in "Gaussian 98 User's Reference" but sometimes needed to obtain *.cube because of an unknown reason.

Files, *.vcs, for VICS are used to overlap ball-and-stick models with isosurfaces in VEND.
