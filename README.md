# Archive files for the VENUS system
Though VENUS systems for Windows and UNIX/Linux have already been completed, only the Windows versions are presented here to save labor. My excuse is that only 2% of visitors of this Web site use UNIX/Linux.

Please refer to Readme.pdf (a guide written in Japanese) and VENUS.pdf in folder VENUS\Documents to learn how to utilize VEND and VICS, and PRIMA.pdf and Manual.pdf in folder VENUS\PRIMA\Documents prior to the use of PRIMA.

The file converter, contrd, for SCAT is contained in VENUS\contrd.

Released to the public, the source code of VEND and VICS is stored in VENUS\Source_code. It will serve (a) to learn techniques to develop crystallographic programs for 3D visualization, (b) to add new features, and (c) to debug the programs.

# License agreement
VEND and VICS are free software; everyone is free to copy, modify, redistribute, and sell them under the terms of the GNU General Public License plus an additional condition described in what follows.
Drawings produced by VEND and/or VICS may be used in any publications provided that proper acknowledgement is given; for example,
Figure 1 was drawn with VENUS developed by Dilanian and Izumi.

This provisional request will be altered in future after publishing a paper concerning the VENUS system.

PRIMA is currently not open-source software, but PRIMA.tbz (or the whole PRIMA folder decompressed from it) may be copied and redistributed just as it is. Whenever original results acquired with PRIMA are published in journals, proceedings, facility reports, etc. or reported in meetings with abstracts, the program name PRIMA should explicitly be credited. Furthermore, cite the following review article (also provisional request):

F. Izumi and R. A. Dilanian, "Recent Research Developments in Physics," Vol. 3, Transworld Research Network, Trivandrum (2002), pp. 699-726. (ISBN 81-7895-046-4)
Only giving credit to PRIMA is good enough in the cases of abstracts, short reports, and so forth with limited spaces.

VENUS may still contain a fair number of bugs. VENUS is distributed in the hope that it will be useful and reliable. It is, however, provided "as is'' without any warranty since I have a number of commitments on my time. There is no charge for the programs, per se, whereas technical service concerning them is not free.
